# Telecom Churn Analysis ??

Losing customers is one of the biggest concerns in any organization, if we can predict their behavior or when they stop using service then we will have better opportunity to make business decisions to stop customers from churn.

In this repo, I will explain code related to churn analysis and by end of this code I will answer to below business questions from the telecom public dataset.

    What is the overall Churn Percentage ?
    Which gender category has more churn rate?
    Which Internet service users has more churn percentage?
    Is high monthly charge leads to high churn ?
    What is the survival curve/probability for the given customer?
    
I am using Telco customer churn dataset from Kaggle, link to the dataset available in notebook.


Code available in python.
Telecom Churn Analysis.ipynb notebook contains code to the development work.
